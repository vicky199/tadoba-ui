          <h6>Problem</h6>
          <p>
            It is difficult to find talented & motivated process mechanics in Germany. Lateral entrants from Germany can work, but the best
            are those talents who have learned the process from scratch and can & want to imagine a career with it.
          </p>
          <h6>General situation:</h6>
          <p>
            Many production companies in plastics processing in Germany have been experiencing a shortage of talented and motivated process
            mechanics for years. Only a few small and medium-sized companies actively use the talent pool from other EU countries. Many
            process mechanics in other EU countries would like to continue their careers in Germany. Small and medium-sized teams in
            particular offer such talents a warm atmosphere and the chance to feel at home.
          </p>

            benefit.
